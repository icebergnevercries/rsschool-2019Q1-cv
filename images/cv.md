**Why i decided to become a web developer?** 

I've been looking for a programming area, that would really interest me for a long time. Only when I helped develop a site to one of my friends. I realized that I want to continue to do this. From that moment on, I am looking for development opportunities in the area of web-development. I believe that The Rolling Scopes School courses are a great opportunity to become a high-class developer and I will definitely take advantage of it.
